# YOLO-v7-OBB
This repo provides the PyTorch implementation of YOLOv7 detection framework with oriented bounding box style discussed in the submitted IROS 2023 conference paper: 'Speech-image based Multimodal AI interaction for Scrub Nurse Asssitance in the Operating Room'.

<!--The instrument dataset (with horizontal and oriented bounding box annotations) can be found on: [onedrive](https://mycuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/1155136569_link_cuhk_edu_hk/EsgIGw9236lDiQBArRMWSmEBhrDXwWv-jGGgaylI4Qq7cQ?e=07SD3S)-->

Codes, trained checkpoints, and dataset used in the paper will be released soon.
